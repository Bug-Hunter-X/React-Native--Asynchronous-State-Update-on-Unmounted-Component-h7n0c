# React Native Asynchronous State Update on Unmounted Component

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native: attempting to update the component's state after it has been unmounted. This typically occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations like network requests that resolve after the component is no longer in the DOM.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a component that fetches data from an API. If the API response is slow, and the component unmounts before the response arrives, React will throw an error: `Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component`. This is because the state update is still attempted even though the component is no longer in the DOM.

## The Solution

The solution is shown in `bugSolution.js`. This improved version adds a flag (`this.mounted`) to indicate whether the component is still mounted.  The state update is conditionally performed only if `this.mounted` is true, preventing the error.

This approach is a common pattern for handling asynchronous operations in React Native components and prevents potential crashes and unexpected behavior.
